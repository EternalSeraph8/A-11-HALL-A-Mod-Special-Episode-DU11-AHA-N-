Hello and thanks for downloading our little mod for our favorite dullahan, Yura!
We've worked really hard to create this as a little gesture for her birthday, and we hope you enjoy playing this mod.

How to install:

1. Backup data.win from your root directory

2. Drop everything in the folder "manual" into your root directory(where "VA-11 Hall A.exe" is).

To check if you did it right, go to 'scripts' and there to 'eng'. There should be a file called "script101.txt". If not, you did it wrong.

3. The mod is installed and ready to be played!

4. To uninstall, put your backup data.win back into your root directory. 

Note:

It's important to replace back the original data.win file before playing the original game.
