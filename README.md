1) Navigate towards va11 halla directory. This can usually be done by Right-clicking Valhalla on steam> Manage> Browse local files.

2) Make a back-up of data.win and keep it a safe folder.

2) Replace the data.win in the file directory for va11 halla with the data.win in the zip folder.

3) Add the script101.txt file to the scripts/eng/ directory.

4) If done right, when you start up the game, there should be a little button titled "YURA" at the top left corner of the title screen. Please press that button to start playing the custom day.

5) Once you're done playing with the custom day, please replace back the data.win with the original data.win that you have made a back-up of to play the default game.
